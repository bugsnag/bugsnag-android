Scenario: Manual session control works
    When I run "ManualSessionSmokeScenario" and relaunch the app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "ManualSessionSmokeScenario"
    And I wait to receive a session

    # Session payload
    Then the session is valid for the session reporting API version "1.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

    Then I wait to receive 3 errors

    # First handled request

    And the event "user.id" equals "123"
    And the event "user.email" equals "ABC.CBA.CA"
    And the event "user.name" equals "ManualSessionSmokeScenario"
    And I discard the oldest error
