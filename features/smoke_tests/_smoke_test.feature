Feature: Performs basic smoke tests to check that critical functionality is working. This allows
         for a faster feedback loop to check that a simple mistake hasn't entirely broken the
         notifier's error reporting, without having to wait for the full suite to run on CI.

    And the payload field "events.0.device.cpuAbi" is a non-empty array

Scenario: Test Unhandled Java Exception with Session
    When I run "UnhandledExceptionJavaScenario" and relaunch the app

    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "java.lang.RuntimeException"

    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGSEGV"
    And the exception "message" equals "Segmentation violation (invalid memory reference)"
    And the exception "type" equals "c"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
