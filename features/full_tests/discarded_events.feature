Feature: Discarding events

    Scenario: Discard an on-disk error that failed to send and is too old
        # Fail to send initial handled error. Client stores it to disk.
        When I set the HTTP status code for the next request to 500
        And I run "DiscardOldEventsScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

        # Fail to send event that was reloaded from disk. Event is too old, so the client discards it.
        Then I discard the oldest error
        # We send another error to keep maze-runner from shutting down the app prematurely.
        And I wait to receive an error
        And I discard the oldest error
        And I set the HTTP status code for the next request to 500
        And I close and relaunch the app
        And I configure Bugsnag for "DiscardOldEventsScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

        # Now there is no event on disk, so there's nothing to send.
        Then I discard the oldest error
        And I close and relaunch the app
        And I configure Bugsnag for "DiscardOldEventsScenario"
        Then I should receive no requests

    Scenario: Discard an on-disk error that failed to send and is too big
        # Fail to send initial handled error. Client stores it to disk.
        When I set the HTTP status code for the next request to 500
        And I run "DiscardBigEventsScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

        # Fail to send event that was reloaded from disk. Event is too old, so the client discards it.
        Then I discard the oldest error
        # We send another error to keep maze-runner from shutting down the app prematurely.
        And I wait to receive an error
        And I discard the oldest error
        And I set the HTTP status code for the next request to 500
        And I close and relaunch the app
        And I configure Bugsnag for "DiscardBigEventsScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

        # Now there is no event on disk, so there's nothing to send.
        Then I discard the oldest error
        And I close and relaunch the app
        And I configure Bugsnag for "DiscardBigEventsScenario"
        Then I should receive no requests
