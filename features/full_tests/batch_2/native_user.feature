    Scenario: Adding user information in Java followed by a C crash
        And I run "CXXJavaUserInfoNativeCrashScenario" and relaunch the app
        And I configure Bugsnag for "CXXJavaUserInfoNativeCrashScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        Then the error payload contains a completed handled native report
        And the exception "errorClass" equals one of:
            | SIGILL |
            | SIGTRAP |
        And the event "severity" equals "error"
