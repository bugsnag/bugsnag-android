    # This scenario will not pass on API levels < 18, as stack corruption
    # is handled without calling atexit handlers, etc.
    # In the device logs you will see:
    # system/bin/app_process([proc id]): stack corruption detected: aborted

    # Refactored here to use abort() on newer versions:
