Feature: Native API

    Scenario: Set extraordinarily long app information
        When I run "CXXExtraordinaryLongStringScenario" and relaunch the app
        And I configure Bugsnag for "CXXExtraordinaryLongStringScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        And the error payload contains a completed handled native report
        And the exception "errorClass" equals one of:
          | SIGILL |
          | SIGTRAP |
        And the event "app.version" equals "22.312.749.78.300.810.24.167.32"
        And the event "context" equals "ObservableSessionInitializerStringParserStringSessionProxyGloba"
        And the event "unhandled" is true

    Scenario: Use the NDK methods without "env" after calling "bugsnag_start"
        When I run "CXXStartScenario"
        And I wait to receive an error
        Then the error payload contains a completed handled native report
        And the event "unhandled" is false
        And the exception "errorClass" equals "Start scenario"
        And the exception "message" equals "Testing env"
        And the event "severity" equals "info"
        And the event has a "log" breadcrumb named "Start scenario crumb"
