Feature: Switching automatic error detection on/off for Unity

  Background:
    Given I clear all persistent data

  Scenario: ANR not captured with autoDetectAnrs=false
    When I run "AutoDetectAnrsFalseScenario"

    And I configure Bugsnag for "AutoDetectAnrsFalseScenario"
    Then Bugsnag confirms it has no errors to send
    #  Wait extra 10 seconds in the end, so appium will have enough time to terminated the previous anr session
