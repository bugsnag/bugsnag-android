## Reporting issues

Are you having trouble getting started? Please [contact us directly](mailto:support@bugsnag.com?subject=%5BGitHub%5D%20Android%20SDK%20-%20having%20trouble%20getting%20started%20with%20Bugsnag) for assistance with integrating Bugsnag into your application.
If you have spotted a problem with this module, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/issues/new). Here are a few things to check before doing so:

* Are you using the latest version of `bugsnag-android`? If not, does updating to the latest version fix your issue?
* Has somebody else [already reported](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen) your issue? Feel free to add additional context to or check-in on an existing issue that matches your own.
* Is your issue caused by this module? Only things related to the `bugsnag-android` module should be reported here. For anything else, please [contact us directly](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) and we'd be happy to help you out.

### Fixing issues

If you've identified a fix to a new or existing issue, we welcome contributions!
Here are some helpful suggestions on contributing that help us merge your PR quickly and smoothly:

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the
  [library on GitHub](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android)
* Build and test your changes using the example app and test suite
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
* Ensure the automated checks pass (and if it fails, please try to address the cause)

### Adding features

Unfortunately we’re unable to accept PRs that add features or refactor the library at this time.
However, we’re very eager and welcome to hearing feedback about the library so please contact us directly to discuss your idea, or open a
[feature request](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) to help us improve the library.

Here’s a bit about our process designing and building the Bugsnag libraries:

* We have an internal roadmap to plan out the features we build, and sometimes we will already be planning your suggested feature!
* Our open source libraries span many languages and frameworks so we strive to ensure they are idiomatic on the given platform, but also consistent in terminology between platforms. That way the core concepts are familiar whether you adopt Bugsnag for one platform or many.
* Finally, one of our goals is to ensure our libraries work reliably, even in crashy, multi-threaded environments. Oftentimes, this requires an intensive engineering design and code review process that adheres to our style and linting guidelines.

Installing the Android SDK
--------------------------

Running `./gradlew` can automatically install both the Gradle build system
and the Android SDK.

If you already have the Android SDK installed, make sure to export the
`ANDROID_HOME` environment variable, for example:

```shell
export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/23.0.2
```

If you don't already have the Android SDK installed, it will be automatically
installed to `~/.android-sdk`.

> Note: You'll need to make sure that the `adb`, `android` and `emulator` tools
> installed as part of the Android SDK are available in your `$PATH` before
> building.


Building the Library
---------------------

You can build new `.aar` files as follows:

```shell
./gradlew clean :build
```

Files are generated into`build/outputs/aar`.


Running Tests
-------------

Running the test suite requires a connected android device or emulator.

You can run the test suite on a device/emulator as follows from within the sdk directory:

```shell
./gradlew connectedCheck
```

Running Lint
------------
You can run lint on the project using the following command:

```shell
./gradlew lint
```

Building the Example App
------------------------

You can build and install the example app to as follows:

```shell
./gradlew clean example:installJavaExampleDebug
```

This builds the latest version of the library and installs an app onto your
device/emulator.


Releasing a New Version
-----------------------

If you are a project maintainer, you can build and release a new version of
`bugsnag-android` as follows:

## One-time setup

-   Create a [Sonatype JIRA](https://issues.sonatype.org) account
-   Ask in the [Bugsnag Sonatype JIRA ticket](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-5533) to become a contributor
-   Ask an existing contributor (likely Simon) to confirm in the ticket
-   Wait for Sonatype them to confirm the approval
-   Create a file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with the following contents:

    ```ini
    # Your credentials for https://oss.sonatype.org/
    # NOTE: An equals sign (`=`) in any of these fields will break the parser
    NEXUS_USERNAME=your-nexus-username
    NEXUS_PASSWORD=your-nexus-password

    # GPG key details
    signing.keyId=your-gpg-key-id # From gpg --list-keys
    signing.password=your-gpg-key-passphrase
    signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/{username}/.gnupg/secring.gpg
    ```

## Every time

### Pre-release Checklist

- [ ] Does the build pass on the CI server?
- [ ] Are all Docs PRs ready to go?
- [ ] Do the installation instructions work when creating an example app from scratch?
- [ ] Has all new functionality been manually tested on a release build?
  - [ ] Ensure the example app sends an unhandled error
  - [ ] Ensure the example app sends a handled error
  - [ ] If a response is not received from the server, is the report queued for later?
  - [ ] If no network connection is available, is the report queued for later?
  - [ ] On a throttled network, is the request timeout reasonable, and the main thread not blocked by any visible UI freeze? (Throttling can be achieved by setting both endpoints to "https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=5000")
  - [ ] Are queued reports sent asynchronously?
- [ ] Have the installation instructions been updated on the [dashboard](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-website/tree/master/app/views/dashboard/projects/install) as well as the [docs site](https://github.com/bugsnag/docs.bugsnag.com)?
