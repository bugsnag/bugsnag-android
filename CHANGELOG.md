## 4.0.0 (2017-08-15)

This is a major release which adds a number of new features to the library. The minimum SDK version supported by Bugsnag is now API 14.

### Breaking Changes

Identifying devices and users (unless overridden) is now captured and persisted
through a per-install generated UUID, replacing use of
`Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID`. As a result, existing errors may see doubled user
counts if they continue to happen. If this is an issue, see the [upgrade
guide](UPGRADING.md#upgrade-from-3x-to-4x)
for more information and a workaround.

### Enhancements
- Support loading different API keys for different product flavors, through manifest placeholders

- Support custom HTTP Error Reporting clients, by allowing custom implementations of `ErrorReportApiClient`

- Add nullability annotations throughout application

- Any exceptions caused by StrictMode will automatically add the policy violation type to the Error Report's metadata

- All tests have been updated to use JUnit 4 rather than `AndroidTestCase`

- Javadoc for the public API is now hosted on Github Pages

- Breadcrumbs are automatically logged for each callback in the Activity Lifecycle, for all activities

- Breadcrumbs are automatically logged for most System Intents (e.g. `android.intent.action.CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`)

- Optimize how reports are sent relative to network connectivity to improve battery life

- Added documentation on how Breadcrumbs can be setup to track the Fragment Lifecycle

- Added Kotlin example app and documentation

- Disable logs by default on release builds

### Bug Fixes
- Handle `RejectionExecutionException` by writing unqueued Error reports to disk
[Damian Wieczorek](https://github.com/damianw)

- Handle IllegalStateException caused by `CharsetEncoder` on Android 6.0
[Ben Lee](https://github.com/Bencodes)

- Each implementation of `beforeNotify()` is now only called once, in the order in which it was added
[jermainedilao](https://github.com/jermainedilao)

- By default, the User ID is now a per-install UUID, whereas previously `Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID` was used
[Martin Georgiev](https://github.com/georgiev-martin)

- Update Gradle dependencies
